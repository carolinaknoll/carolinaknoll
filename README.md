## 👋 Hi, I'm Kimi!


👩‍🌾 I'm a young __Software & Mobile Engineer__ who believes in kindness, heroes and _[human super powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue)._ :sparkles:   
💻 I usually work with React, React Native, Context, Redux, Gatsby, CSS Modules, TypeScript, Bitrise and Netlify.   
📖 I’m also enthusiastic about helping connect __technology__ and __education__ to promote meaningful and better-informed learning opportunities.

🎨 I'm deeply interested in:
- Exercise and martial arts (I practice Kung Fu), and the challenges that come with it.
- Having fun and doing lively things (I play Stardew Valley, board games, and watch anime).
- Doing something that connects us to the present (like nurturing faith and growing vegetables).

🎨 On learning, I also notice:
- Different forms of apprehension, and how the human mind can learn. 
- Learning as a continuous, lifelong process - _that is, not one that ends after a diploma._
- How different people learn at different rhythms and ways. _We all have strengths and weaknesses._
- Education for independence and freedom, not only just locked up to schools. Learning _can happen anyhow and anywhere._
- Learning to be prepared for life’s challenges and adventures - _not for passing standardized tests and getting good grades._

## 🎗️ My motto

We humans are so used to science fiction and **big, loud** movie explosions that we forget that there are many amazing, rich, fantastic powers, mostly _hidden right inside ourselves_ :star2::
- the power of _choosing kindness,_ 
- of showing _support_ to a person _in need_ on a challenging time, 
- of lending a _much needed hug_ or, quite simply, 
- of being able to _go through_ a hard day. :blossom:

Day after day, I try to apply these thoughts into my actions. _That's where the super powers come from._ :pencil:
