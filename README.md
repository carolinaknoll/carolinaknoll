### Hi there! はじめまして! 

*(that's 'nice to meet you' in Japanese)*! :sweat_smile: 

I'm a young human coder who believes in heroes and super powers :sparkles: and that means, I believe in YOU! :rose: :rocket: 

We humans are so used to science fiction and big, loud movie explosions that we forget that there are many amazing, rich, fantastic powers, mostly hidden right inside ourselves :star2: — the power of choosing kindness, of showing support to a person in need on a challenging time, of lending a much needed hug or, quite simply, of being able to go through a hard day. :blossom:

Day after day, I try to apply these thoughts into my actions. That's where the super powers come from. :pencil: 

I work with front-end development, and some magic words include React, Redux, Gatsby, CSS Modules and Netlify. After work I usually attend Kung Fu classes :punch:, defeat some [monsters](https://store.steampowered.com/app/105600/Terraria/) :hocho:, grab fresh vegetables from plants on my [farm](https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley/) :watermelon: and watch some heartwarming [anime shows](https://myanimelist.net/anime/31964/Boku_no_Hero_Academia).

If you'd like to know a bit more, I gently invite you to my [website](https://carolinaknoll.github.io/).
