I'm a young Software Engineer who believes in kindness, heroes and human super powers. :sparkles:   
Some tech-related magic words include React, React Native, Redux, Gatsby, CSS Modules, TypeScript _(sometimes)_ and Netlify.   

I'm also deeply interested in different forms of Education, and how the human mind can learn. ðŸŽ¨   
   
Schools today, _especially with the pandemic,_ are not as beneficial as they could, and once were. In this case, how can _we_ bring Education home? I am particularly interested in uniting [Montessori](https://sapientiamontessori.com/montessori/about-montessori/) with [Classical Education](https://classicalacademicpress.com/pages/what-is-classical-education). Not only for children and young ones, but for adults as well. I am also a strong believer that [socialization](https://welltrainedmind.com/a/what-about-socialization/?v=19d3326f3137) doesn't just happen at schools.

And yup, I'm also a normal human being as well. I enjoy anime, [Batsu Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batsu_game), Stardew Valley/Terraria and practice Kung Fu, so ask me anything you'd like. ðŸ˜„

We humans are so used to science fiction and **big, loud** movie explosions that we forget that there are many amazing, rich, fantastic powers, mostly _hidden right inside ourselves_ :star2: â€” the power of choosing kindness, of showing support to a person in need on a challenging time, of lending a much needed hug or, quite simply, of being able to go through a hard day. :blossom:

Day after day, I try to apply these thoughts into my actions. That's where the super powers come from. :pencil:
