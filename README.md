### Hi there! はじめまして! 

*(that's 'hajimemashite', nice to meet you in Japanese)*! :sweat_smile:

I'm a young front-end dev who believes in kindness, heroes and human super powers. :sparkles:   
Some magic words include React, Redux, Gatsby, CSS Modules and Netlify.   
I am currently learning about React Native and building for Android/iOS devices too! :bowtie:   

Outside work I also enjoy to...   
Defeat some [monsters](https://store.steampowered.com/app/105600/Terraria/). :hocho:  
Grab fresh vegetables from plants on my [farm](https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley/). :watermelon:  
Watch some heartwarming [anime shows](https://myanimelist.net/anime/31964/Boku_no_Hero_Academia).  

We can also chat if you'd like to know more about...   
Practicing Kung Fu! — I'm an jade green belt, so ask me anything. :woman_cartwheeling:   
Learning Latin - Yup, it can be considered a dead language, but it's also the root of many other languages we use daily. :memo:   
Education - Traditional class education works, but demands learning about too many things that are then easily forgotten. How we can make it better? :jigsaw:

We humans are so used to science fiction and **big, loud** movie explosions that we forget that there are many amazing, rich, fantastic powers, mostly _hidden right inside ourselves_ :star2: — the power of choosing kindness, of showing support to a person in need on a challenging time, of lending a much needed hug or, quite simply, of being able to go through a hard day. :blossom:

Day after day, I try to apply these thoughts into my actions. That's where the super powers come from. :pencil: 

If you'd like to know a bit more, I gently invite you to my [website](https://carolinaknoll.github.io/).
