We humans are so used to science fiction and big, loud movie explosions that we forget that there are many amazing, rich, fantastic powers, mostly hidden right inside ourselves :star2: — the power of choosing kindness, of showing support to a person in need on a challenging time, of lending a much needed hug or, quite simply, of being able to go through a hard day. :blossom:

Day after day, I try to apply these thoughts into my actions. That's where the super powers come from. :pencil: 

If you'd like to know a bit more, I gently invite you to my [website](https://carolinaknoll.github.io/).
