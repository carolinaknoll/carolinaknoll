I'm a young Mobile/Software Engineer who believes in kindness, heroes and human super powers. :sparkles:   
Some tech-related magic words include React, React Native, Context, Redux, Gatsby, CSS Modules, TypeScript _(when other team members are also comfortable with using it)_, Bitrise and Netlify.   

I'm also deeply interested in different forms of Education, and how the human mind can learn. ðŸŽ¨   
   
I am a strong believer that considering education as a continuous process - _that is, not one that ends after a diploma_ - is a fantastic way to nurture a healthy perspective on life and keep growing. I believe that empowering people with the best assets they can have is key for a healthy, thoughtful and stable life. 

It can start with children and teens being given tools and knowledge to make choices and be independent and corageous, or also start with parents closely watching so that these needs are met and making responsible educational choices, be it by choosing a public or private school, or be it by doing education at home with resources that might work best.

I am particularly interested in uniting [Montessori](https://sapientiamontessori.com/montessori/about-montessori/) with [Classical Education](https://classicalacademicpress.com/pages/what-is-classical-education). Not only for children and young ones, but for adults as well. I am also a strong believer that [socialization](https://welltrainedmind.com/a/what-about-socialization/?v=19d3326f3137) doesn't just happen at schools.

And yup, I'm also a normal human being as well. I enjoy anime, [Batsu Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batsu_game), Stardew Valley/Terraria and practice Kung Fu, so ask me anything you'd like. ðŸ˜„

We humans are so used to science fiction and **big, loud** movie explosions that we forget that there are many amazing, rich, fantastic powers, mostly _hidden right inside ourselves_ :star2: â€” the power of choosing kindness, of showing support to a person in need on a challenging time, of lending a much needed hug or, quite simply, of being able to go through a hard day. :blossom:

Day after day, I try to apply these thoughts into my actions. _That's where the super powers come from._ :pencil:
